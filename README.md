# Human Readable Base4096

Base64 is a great way to represent binary in ASCII printable letters.  
But I want to push the idea to the edge and came up with the idea of Base4096.

## What is it?
In Base64, binary is represented by all of alphanumeric letters, `+`, `-`, which is in total 64 letters. Because `64=2^6`, **one letter can represent 6 bits in binary**.  
If we use a character set, which contains `4096=2^12` characters, **one letter can represent 12 bits of information**, which is double the amount of Base64.  


But are there 4096 printable characters, let alone human-readable ones?
Yes, and it is CJK Unified Ideographs, commonly referred as Chinese Characters or Kanji. In Unicode, there are more than 20K of those.
